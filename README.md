# How to submit a project idea?
- Create a github issue with the project in mind
- The title of the issue should contain an idea already of the project
- The description should be elaborate and straight to the point
- Listing the technology type isn't really important
- submit the issue and once the project get's accepted, it will be added as a folder in the main repository ie if the Github issue is open
